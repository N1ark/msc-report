\chapter{Proofs of soundness}

Here we present proofs of soundness for some of the showcased state models. In \cref{proofs:ex-soundness} we show the soundness of the \Ex{} state model, the simplest state model; in \cref{proofs:pmap-soundness} we prove it for \PMap{}, a more complex state model transformer; in \cref{proofs:syntpmap-soundness}, \cref{proofs:splitpmap-soundness} and \cref{proofs:alocpmap-soundness} we show the soundness results for three optimisations of \PMap: syntactic checks, \SplitPMap{} and \ALocPMap{} respectively.
