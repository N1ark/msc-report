Firstly, I would like to thank my supervisor, Philippa Gardner, along with all the wonderful members and friends of the Verified Software team: Andreas, Caroline, Daniele, Nat, Petar, Sacha, and Simon. None of this would have been possible without the help, advice, and various conversations we had! I learnt a lot in just a few months and it radically changed my perception of computer science (for the best, of course).

I also would want to thank my friends for their support throughout the year and for bringing me so much joy; I feel incredibly lucky to have friends from all over the world that care for me!

Finally, I thank my family for being there for me, I love you all very much.
