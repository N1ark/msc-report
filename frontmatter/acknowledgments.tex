Firstly, I would like to thank my supervisor, Philippa Gardner, along with all the wonderful Verified Software team and friends at Imperial College London: Andreas, Caroline, Daniele, Nat, Petar, Sacha and Simon. None of this would have been possible without the help, advice and various conversations we've had!
